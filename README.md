## Introduction
In the modern world, integration between applications is a fundamental aspect of creating agile and efficient solutions. Relational databases play a critical role as repositories of structured information. However, direct access can be challenging, especially in scenarios requiring decentralized and secure communication.

RestDB4J simplifies interactions with relational databases by providing a RESTful interface. It supports common database operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting. The solution is ideal for teams seeking to access or manipulate data without managing drivers, SQL languages, or complex configurations.

### Key Benefits
- **Interoperability**: Support for various relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).
- **Ease of Use**: Perform database operations through REST endpoints.
- **Standardization**: Unified interface for consistent communication.
- **Security**: Configurable access control to protect data.
- **Scalability**: Perfect for distributed applications and microservices.

## Motivation
Modern applications face challenges such as:
- Diverse drivers and configurations for different databases.
- The need to learn SQL for direct queries.
- Security risks when exposing direct database connections.
- Integration complexity in microservice architectures.

RestDB4J addresses these issues by offering:
- A RESTful API for decentralized and flexible database access.
- A simplified HTTP interface eliminating the need for SQL.
- Process standardization through REST conventions.
- Improved security via controlled endpoints.
- Interoperability with any HTTP-compatible language or tool.
